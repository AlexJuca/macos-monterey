# macOS Monterey

[![Node.js CI](https://github.com/AlexJuca/macos-monterey/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/AlexJuca/macos-monterey/actions/workflows/node.js.yml)

This project is a clone of macOS Monterey that runs in your browser.
It was built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and React.

# Why was this project created?

Simple really. I am a backend engineer but I recently had to learn React. So, after following
this tutorial by [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-react/) and reading the official React documentation I challenged myself to build a clone of macOS Monterey that runs in the browser.

# Current UI

This is how our current UI is, we aim to bring it as close as possible to macOS as possible.

# Roadmap

Currently, this is being tracked in a private Notion board but the general idea is to make
this look and work as much as possible to the native version of macOS.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:AlexJuca/macos-monterey.git
cd macos-monterey/

npm install

npm start

# To run on a specific port
HOST=YOUR_IP npm start
```
